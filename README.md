# UnityPlayground

This is a playground project where I tested out different prototype and game ideas.

## Procedural Level Generation
Infinite rooms connected to each other as the player traverse through them.

## [Procedural Terrain Generation](https://github.com/casrom/UnityPlayground/tree/master/Assets/Scripts/MC)
Infinite terrain generation using Marching Cube, compute shaders, and support LOD.
